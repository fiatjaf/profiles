## `kind` `05` `follow-list`

`draft` `optional`

All the keys a public key is following



`05`: `follow-list`: has no `content` 

`p` `tag` for each public key following

The relay should keep the public key's most recent  `kind` `05` event, and discard the rest

    {
      id: <32-bytes sha256 of the serialized event data>
      pubkey: <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      created_at: <unix timestamp>,
      kind: 5,
      tags: [
        ["p", <32-bytes hex of public-key being followed>],
        ["p", <32-bytes hex of public-key being followed>],
        ["p", <32-bytes hex of public-key being followed>],
        ["p", <32-bytes hex of public-key being followed>]
      ]
      sig: <64-bytes signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>,
    }
