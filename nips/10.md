Proof of Work
-------------

`draft` `optional` `author:cerbwm`

A user may want to produce proof of work (POW) to call attention to a cetain event.
When a POW is available, it MAY be included in the event body under the `pow` key:

```
{
  id: ...,
  kind: ...,
  ...,
  ...,
  pow: [[<string name of POW algorithm>, <nonce, as a (lowercase) hex string>], ...]
}
```

Both clients and relays MAY validate the POW by
hashing the concatenation of the event id and the nonce
(after both are decoded from their hex representations).

The POW can be provided by relays, as a paid service, or
by the publishing users themselves when they first upload the event to relays.

## POW Vote Events

Using a new event with kind `6`,
clients MAY submit additional POW for other events.

The tag entry of kind `6` events MUST contain one "e" event id to upvote.
the `content` field of kind `6` events must contain the name of the
POW algorithm and the hex encoded POW nonce as a two element json array.

### Relay Usage

Relays MAY validate kind `6` events and discard them
after updating the POW on the refered event if the new POW is better.
This is not required since relays may not have knowledge of all referenced events.

### Client Usage

Clients MAY also validate kind `6` events and discard them
after updating the POW on the refered event if the new POW is better.
Clients MAY display the POW in any format, or not at all.

If a user wants to call attention to an event in a way that
advertises their identity,
the user MAY add POW to a simple kind `1` `text_note`
that references the event they want to call attention to.
