Proof of Work
-------------

`draft` `optional` `author:cerbwm`

A user may want to call attention to an event by
including proof of work (POW) with the event.
Similarly, to limit the number of events,
a relay may require that each event come with a certain amount of POW.
In either case, the POW is based on the cuckoo-cycle algorithm described
in [BIP154](https://bips.xyz/154#cuckoo-cycle-1).
When a POW is available, it MAY be included in the event body under the `pow` key:

```
{
  id: ...,
  kind: ...,
  ...,
  ...,
  pow: <64-bytes hex encoded nonce>
}
```

Both clients and relays MAY validate the POW by
hashing the concatenation of the event id and the nonce
(after both are decoded from their hex representations).

## Client Usage

Clients MAY display the POW in any format, or not at all.

If a client receives multiple versions of the same event, with different POWs,
the client MUST validate the POWs and discard the lesser
before displaying the POW.

Clients MAY allow users to attempt to add POW to an event by trying nonces.
If a better nonce is found,
the client can send the event back to relays with the improved POW.

## Relay Usage

If a relay receives the event multiple, with different POWs
the relay MAY validate the POWs and store only the best POW.
Note that this should not unduly burden relays,
since as as the POW improves,
the amount of work required to find a better POW
increases exponentially.
